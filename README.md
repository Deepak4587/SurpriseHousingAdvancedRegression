## Problem Statement
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.
- The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.


## Data Preparation
- Dummy values were added in place of variables that are categorical in nature.
- The unnecessary columns were removed from the dataset.
- A taining set and test set were created.


## Model Building and Evaluation
- Linear, Lasso and Ridge regression models were created.
- The R2, RSS, MSE values etc. were found and analyzed.
- The variables with higheset coefficent and hence the highest relation with target variable were found.


## Conclusions
- There are factors that have both positive and negative impact on the target variable.
- All the factors that were analysed and had an impact are found and documented.
